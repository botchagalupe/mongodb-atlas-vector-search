# Comparing Vector Search Results for Different Embedding Models

This is a fun experiment to see how differnet embeddings affect the search results.

MongoDb Atlas is neutral on embeddings.  We can plug in any embedding model.

Here I have setup two embeddings using two different models

- OpenAI embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002): This model is available via API call only.  [more information](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model)
- BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5: This is an open source model. [more information](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)

## Results

And here are the top-5 vector search results, for the query :

**"humans fighting aliens"**

The search score in bracket (0.85) is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.  Closer to 1.0 is better!  We see OpenAI models are scoring higher in the 0.8 range.  Open source model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) is scoring in 0.6 - 0.7 range.  Not bad!

**Update:** ON Jan 25, 2024, OpenAI has announced new embedding models: `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`. [Read more](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates).  I will update the results with the new models.

Overall the Top-5 results are pretty similar.  Which is good to see.

You can read the plot lines to see evaulate the matches yourself ðŸ˜„
