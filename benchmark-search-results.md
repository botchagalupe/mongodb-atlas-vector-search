# Comparing Vector Search Results for Different Embedding Models

This is a fun experiment to see how differnet embeddings affect the search results.

MongoDb Atlas is neutral on embeddings.  We can plug in any embedding model.

## Models

Here I have setup two embeddings using two different models

- OpenAI embedding model [more information](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model)
- BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5: This is an open source model. [more information](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)

|                     | OpenAI Embedding Model (text-embedding-ada-002)  | BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5         |

| Execution time (ms) | 100 - 200 ms (includes network latency)          | 6 ms (on GPU) ,  9 ms (on CPU) |

| Model Parameters    | Unknown                                          | 33.5 M                         |


**Update:** On Jan 25, 2024, OpenAI has announced new embedding models: `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`.  They are showing good improvements over the `text-embedding-ada-002` model that I have used. [Read more](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates).  I will update the results with the new models.

## Search Results

And here are the top-5 vector search results, for some queries.

How to interpret the search results.

The search score in bracket (0.85) is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.  Closer to 1.0 is better!   The results are sorted by search score (decreasing order)

You can read the plot lines to see evaulate the search results yourself ðŸ˜„

 We see OpenAI models are scoring higher in the 0.8 range.  Open source model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) is scoring in 0.6 - 0.7 range.  Not bad!

Overall the Top-5 results are pretty similar.  Which is good to see.
